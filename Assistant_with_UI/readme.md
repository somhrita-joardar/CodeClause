DESCRIPTION

A user-friendly voice assistant with a graphical user interface. When the user clicks the microphone button, the application should record the user's voice, process the command, and display the interpreted command on the screen. The assistant should then respond with relevant information, solutions, or feedback based on the command.

EXPLANATION:

Speech Recognition: Captures audio and converts it to text.

Command Processing: Based on the recognized command, a specific response is generated.

Text-to-Speech: The response is converted to speech and spoken aloud.

Flask App: Manages the web interface and handles voice commands.

JavaScript: Handles the button click event, sends a POST request to the server, and updates the display area with the command and response.
